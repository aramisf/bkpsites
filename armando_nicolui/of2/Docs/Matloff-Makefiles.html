 <h2><a name="tth_sEc1">
1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical Overview</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.1">
1.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Managing Size and Complexity</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In commercial software engineering environments, a program is typically
large and complex.  In order to better manage that size and complexity,
good software practice is, as you know, to use modular, top-down design,
with a large number of function calls.  There typically are dozens, even
hundreds of functions.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
During the debugging of such a program, we will make a change to the
source code, then compile and run, then make another change to the source
code, then compile and run again, and so on.  However, this is wasteful:
We usually will change only a small <u>part</u> of the program each 
time, but we must recompile the <u>entire</u> program, including the
parts which were not changed and thus should not have to be recompiled.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
With this problem in mind, we typically will split the source code into
a large number of files, rather than just one file.  We may, for
example, have a separate file for each significant function, and maybe
one more file for the small, miscellaneous functions.  Each file will
have a name whose suffix is .c.  We will compile each of these files
separately, yielding machine-language files with .o suffices.  Finally,
we will use the linker, ld (which is a separate program from the
compiler, but is called by the compiler), to link all the .o files into
one executable file named a.out or some other name which we choose
ourselves.  When we subsequently make a change to our program, if that
change affects only one of the .c files, we only recompile
<u>that</u> file, forming a revised .o file.  We then link again.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>This saves a large amount of time!</b>  A large program might take, say,
10 or 15 minutes to compile in its entirety, whereas with the approach
described here we might only recompile a small portion of the program.
The time saved-and far more important, the minimizing of the interruption 
to the programmer's train of thought during the debugging process-can 
increase productivity tremendously.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.2">
1.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did I Remember to Recompile That File or Not?"</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In the frenzy of the debugging process, it is easy to get confused.
One might make a couple of changes to some of the source files, but
then when recompiling them lose track of which files one has recompiled
and which still remain to be recompiled.  To simplify life, the Unix
<b>make</b> program is used.<a href="#tthFtNtAAB" name="tthFrefAAB"><sup>1</sup></a>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <b>make</b> program will automatically decide whether a file needs
to be recompiled or not.  The way it does this is quite simple:  If
the last date/time of modification for the .c file is later than that
of the corresponding .o file, the latter is obviously out of date, and
thus the former must be recompiled.  Whenever the programmer makes a
change (or several changes), he/she simply types `make', and the required 
recompiling and relinking will be done automatically.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also, if we have a set of modules which will be used by many programs,
we create a <i>library</i> out of them.  Then in compiling any program which uses
that set of modules, we simply include the library as if it were a .o
file.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc2">
2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Example</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here I have taken our program WC.c and split it into a number of files,
and also set up a file for <b>make</b> to use.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.1">
2.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview of the Files</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here are the contents of my directory:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>Defs.h          Main.c          ReadLine.c      WordCount.c
ExternVars.h    PrintLine.c     UpdateCounts.c

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have placed each function in its own file, e.g. I've put the function
ReadLine() in the file ReadLine.c.  Main.c contains main(), and also the
declarations of the global variables.  For each of the latter, I have
put an <b>extern</b> entry in the file ExternVars.h; accordingly, in each
of the .c files except Main.c, I have put in a line

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>#include "ExternVars.h"

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've also made a file Defs.h for any #define lines which I need.
The file Makefile contains the instructions for <b>make</b>.

(Note that I have added line numbers only to Makefile, but even then,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.3">
2.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of Header Files</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
All the .c files above have a line

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>#include "Defs.h"

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What an <b>include</b> statement does is tell the compiler to make a 
copy of the indicated file and compile it together with the file
containing the <b>include</b>.  For example, when the file PrintLine.c
is being compiled, the compiler will see the <b>include</b>, and simply
pretend that the entire contents of Defs.h had been in PrintLine.c.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
All the .c files except for Main.c also have a line

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>#include "ExternVars.h"

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Again, when the compiler is compiling, say, WordCount.c, it will simply
act as if all the lines in ExternVars.h were in WordCount.c.  This is a
convenient way to get all the <b>extern</b> statements we need into
WordCount.c, ReadLine.c and so on.  It's just a convenience to avoid
typing, but it also helps clear our minds-we don't have to remember
to put in all the <b>extern</b> lines in each of these files.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Note that it wouldn't make sense to have the line

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>#include "ExternVars.h"

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
in Main.c, since the global variables are being declared there, thus
making <b>extern</b> statements for these variables incorrect.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Note too that I have put in <b>extern</b>'s for the functions; e.g. I
have the line

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>extern int ReadLine(),WordCount();

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
in Main.c.  I don't really need this, since C assumes a function's
return value type is <b>int</b> by default, but I would need it for
non-<b>int</b> types, and thus it is a good habit to have such a
statement even though the two functions concerned here are of <b>int</b>
type.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The .h files should be for variable declarations, "define's" and
other include's.  They should not include any program statements
(other than macros).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc2.4">
2.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Details of Using `make'</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now let's take a look at the file Makefile.  It consists of a series of 
<b>dependency/build</b> entries; Lines 3-4 comprise one such entry, Lines 6-7 
form another, etc.<a href="#tthFtNtAAC" name="tthFrefAAC"><sup>2</sup></a>  Each such entry tells first, what other files a
given file depends on, and second, how to rebuild the given file if one of
the ones it depends on changes.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For instance, look at Lines 3-4.  Here Line 3 is a <b>dependency line</b>,
while Line 4 is a <b>command line</b>.  The file WC, which is our
executable file for the program, is called a <b>target file</b>, meaning
a file which we hope to build; Lines 3-4 provide information

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<ul>
<br>(a) as to whether the current version of the target is outdated (Line 3), and
<br>(b) 
if the target is outdated, how to rebuild it (Line 4).</ul>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Specifically, Line 3 says that WC depends on a number of .o files, i.e.
Main.o, ReadLine.o, WordCount.o, UpdateCounts.o and PrintLine.o.  So, if 
<b>make</b> is told to produce the file WC, it will check whether the current
version of WC is at least as new as these .o files; if even one of these
files is newer than WC, <b>make</b> will see that WC is out of date, and
will rebuild WC, using the prescription in the command line, Line 4.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A couple of things about the latter should be noted.  First, we are using the 
-o option of <b>cc</b>, which states that we don't want the default name of
a.out for our executable file; we want the executable file to be named
WC.  Second, note that there are no .c files in this command at all, 
so there is no compiling to be done; why, then, are we using <b>cc</b>?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The answer to the last question is that <b>cc</b> automatically calls
<b>ld</b>, the Unix linker command; this is always done, but you have 
not had a chance to be aware of it before now.  In this case, we need
all those .o files to be linked together into one executable file
(WC), and calling <b>cc</b> will result in <b>ld</b> being called
to do the linking.<a href="#tthFtNtAAD" name="tthFrefAAD"><sup>3</sup></a>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In general, a makefile consists of sets of lines of the form we see in 
Lines 3-4, i.e. in the form

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>target: dependency components
TAB shell command
TAB shell command
TAB shell command
...

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(where TAB means the tab key, not the string `TAB').  Note that for
instance Line 4 is a shell command.<a href="#tthFtNtAAE" name="tthFrefAAE"><sup>4</sup></a>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Let's see <b>make</b> in action:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>  1 heather% ls

 19	heather% make
 20	cc -g -c WordCount.c
 21	cc -g -o WC Main.o ReadLine.o WordCount.o UpdateCounts.o PrintLine.o

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
At first, we see that there are no .o files at all (Lines 2-3).
When we type "make" (Line 4), <b>make</b> will read the file Makefile 
and try to build the first item it encounters (if it is not already 
up-to-date), which is WC, which depends on all the .o files (Line 3 of the
Makefile listing).  Since none of those files exist, <b>make</b> will
have to generate them, and to do so, it looks further down in the file
Makefile.  For example, it sees on Line 6 of the Makefile that it can
build Main.o by doing "cc -g -c Main.c" (the -c means compile only, i.e.
just produce a .o file, and don't call <b>ld</b>), and it goes ahead and
does so (Line 5 of the script file).  After generating all the .o files,
it then links them (Line 10 of the script file).  Now all the .o files 
have been generated, as has WC.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now let's update a file, say WordCount.c, and see what happens.  Lines
11-18 of the script file show me making a change to this file, by adding a
<b>#define</b> line (I used the <b>ex</b> editor so that it could be seen
easily within the script file).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now let's see how <b>make</b> will handle this change (Lines 19ff). What
happened is that <b>make</b> found that WC depends on WordCount.o (Line 3
of Makefile), which in turn depends on WordCount.c (Line 12 of Makefile),
and <b>make</b> noticed that the timestamp on WordCount.c was later than that
of WordCount.o, i.e. the latter was out-of-date.  So, <b>make</b> first
recompiled WordCount.c, to produce an up-to-date WordCount.o, and then
linked all the .o files together to produce an up-to-date file WC.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
By the way, we can also specify individual targets with <b>make</b>.  For
exmaple, if for some reason we wanted to only build ReadLine.o, we could
type

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>make ReadLine.o

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Note the <b>cc</b> will also call <b>ld</b>, the linker.  In Line 21, for
example, the real work of linking all those .o files together into an 
executable file  will be done by <b>ld</b>.  For this reason, the <b>
cc</b> command line might include some options which you don't find in the
<b>man</b> page for <b>cc</b>; these are options for <b>ld</b>, and 
will be passed on to the latter by <b>cc</b>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc3">
3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;More Sophisticated Use of Make</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <b>make</b> program is extremely powerful, and is capable of much more
than we see in this simple introduction. For example, one can define
variables, as in the following version of Makefile:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>CC = cc

wc: Main.o ReadLine.o WordCount.o PrintLine.o 
	$(CC) -o wc Main.o ReadLine.o WordCount.o PrintLine.o 

Main.o: Main.c Include.h
	$(CC) -g -c Main.c

ReadLine.o: ReadLine.c Include.h
	$(CC) -g -c ReadLine.c

WordCount.o: WordCount.c Include.h
	$(CC) -g -c WordCount.c

PrintLine.o: PrintLine.c Include.h
	$(CC) -g -c PrintLine.c

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here we have defined the variable CC (when referring to it, we must
include the dollar sign and parentheses) to be cc, the usual C
compiler.  The advantage of doing this is that if we instead wanted
to use the Gnu C compiler, gcc, all we would have to do is change
that one line in Makefile to

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>CC = gcc

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
instead of having to change all the lines where cc had been used.
For large, complex programs with very long makefiles, this is a
big help.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Note that any shell command can be put in the target entries;
this is also a very powerful feature.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To learn more, see the man page as a first step, and the GNU
documentation (available with <b>make</b> at ftp sites).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 <h2><a name="tth_sEc4">
4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Library Archive Files</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc4.1">
4.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Basics</h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When we have a collection of functions which often use, it is convenient
to collect their compiled versions into a <b>library archive</b> file,
which has a suffix of, for example, .a.  Say for example we have some
functions in files x.c and y.c.  After compiling them into .o files
(using cc's -c option), we could then type

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>ar r z.a x.o y.o

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This would create the file z.a containing x.o and y.o.  (After running
<b>ar</b>, we often will follow up with <b>ranlib</b>, which will add an
index of the contents to the file.)  If we then had a source file w.c
which made calls to functions in x.c and y.c, we could simply type

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>cc w.c z.a

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The compiler would compile w.c and then link the modules in z.a to
it, resulting in an executable file a.out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You see above how you can make your own library archives.  There are
also archives for the C library, for the X11 windows functions and so
on, which are on every Unix system (though they may be in different
directories).  If for example you want to call the C library's square
root function, sqrt(), you put "-lm" on your compiler command line,
e.g.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>cc r.c -lm

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In doing so you are also linking in a library archive, libm.a,
which contains all the C library math functions.  The notation
"-lsomething" means, "link in an archive named libsomething.a"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Where does the compiler find these library archives?  First, the
compiler knows to search in certain "official" directories, such
as /usr/lib.  But if you have your own archive elsewhere, you have
various options available to you.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For example, you can link archives in explicitly, by placing the full
path name on the compiler command line, e.g.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>cc abc.c /u/v/libq.a

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(Note again that here <b>cc</b> is not only compiling abc.c, but is also
linking the archive file /u/v/libq.a.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Or, if your archive is named libsomething.a, you can use the compiler's
-L option, say

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>cc def.c -L/u/v -lq

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This tells the compiler that it should add the directory /u/v to the
list of directories it searches for libraries, including in this case
libq.a.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Similarly, the compiler's -I option tells the compiler to add the
given directory to the list of directories where the compiler searches
for include-files specified by "elbows."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For instance, say the file ghi.c contains a line

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>#include &lt;zzz.h&gt;

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Then

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>cc -I/m/n ghi.c

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
tells the compiler to look for this include-file (and others) in /m/n,
in addition to its standard spot /usr/include.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Typical makefiles contain many -L and -I constructs.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
      <h4><a name="tth_sEc4.2.1">
4.2.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dynamic Libraries</h4>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
By default, libraries are <i>statically linked</i>.  For example, in our
command line above,

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>cc abc.c /u/v/libq.a

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
then the resulting executable file, a.out, will contain a copy of
libq.a.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But if many programs use libq.a, this would be wasteful of disk space,
since that would mean that many copies of libq.a would be stored on
disk.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A better alternative would be <i>dynamic linking</i>.  In this case,
instead of a.out containing a copy of libq.a, there would be "note" in
that file explaining that libq.a is needed, and that when a.out is
loaded, the file libq.a should be loaded together with a.out.  This way,
the disk would have only one copy of libq.a, not many.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In Unix, the dynamically-linked library files are generally given .so
("shared object") suffixes in their names, e.g. libm.so.6 for the math
library, where the `6' indicates a version number.<a href="#tthFtNtAAF" name="tthFrefAAF"><sup>5</sup></a>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Creation of dynamically-linkable libraries requires careful usage of the
compiler, linker and the shell environment.  It is not enough to use the
-L and -l command-line options at compile time, because at run time the
loader will not know which directories to look in to find the dynamic
library specified by the "note."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One approach to solving this problem is to have the user set the
environment variable  LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  In the C shell, for example,
the directories /x/y/z can be added to this path via the command

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>setenv  LD_LIBRARY_PATH /x/y/z

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is the easy way to go, and I recommend it.  However, you may not
want to bother the user with this, and there are other reasons to avoid
it.<a href="#tthFtNtAAG" name="tthFrefAAG"><sup>6</sup></a>  Or you can add a line

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>/x/y/z

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
to your file <b>/etc/ld.so.conf</b>, which will take effect the next time
you boot up.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The GNU version of C/C++ compiler, <b>gcc</b>, features a command-line
option, -fPIC, specifying that the compiler create <i>
position-independent code</i>, while allows it to exist anywhere in memory,
rather than at a particular distance from a.out.  The <b>ld</b>
command-line option -rpath (again, this is typically passed to <b>ld</b>
by <b>gcc</b>), results in a note in a.out specifying which directory to
look for the library if the OS does not find it in the places the OS
usually searches.  The <b>ld</b> option -Bdynamic specifies that the
executable file a.out load its libraries dynamically.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The original library load path is gotten at bootup from the file
/etc/ld.so.conf

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A lot of this can be automated if one uses a GNU program, <b>libtool</b>,
when invoking <b>gcc</b>.  The command line will have the form

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<pre>libtool gcc &lt;options&gt;

</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, here we are actually running <b>libtool</b>, but it in turn fires up
<b>gcc</b>.  The design of <b>libtool</b> is such that it will provide
exactly the right options to <b>gcc</b>, e.g. -fPIC, in order to produce
dynamically-linked executables.<a href="#tthFtNtAAH" name="tthFrefAAH"><sup>7</sup></a>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sometimes you might download a binary package from the Web, e.g. free
RPM packages for Linux, only to find that they tell you a library is
missing.  You can use the <b>ldd</b> command to get more detailed
information, and then either download the missing libraries, or if
you have them, put them in directories where the OS will see them.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
