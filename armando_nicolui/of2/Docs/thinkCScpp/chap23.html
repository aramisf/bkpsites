<h2>Chapter 23</h2>

<h1>File Input/Output and pmatrices</h1>


<p>In this chapter we will develop a program that reads and writes files, parses input, and demonstrates the <span class=code>pmatrix</span> class.  We will also implement a data structure called <span class=code>Set</span> that expands automatically as you add elements.</p>

<p>Aside from demonstrating all these features, the real purpose of the program is to generate a two-dimensional table of the distances between cities in the United States. The output is a table that looks like this:</p>


<span class=code>Atlanta 0
<br>Chicago 700&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0
<br>Boston&nbsp; 1100&nbsp; &nbsp; 1000&nbsp; &nbsp; 0
<br>Dallas&nbsp; 800&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;900&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1750&nbsp; &nbsp; 0
<br>Denver&nbsp; 1450&nbsp; &nbsp; 1000&nbsp; &nbsp; 2000&nbsp; &nbsp; 800&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0
<br>Detroit 750&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;300&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;800&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1150&nbsp; &nbsp; 1300&nbsp; &nbsp; 0
<br>Orlando 400&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1150&nbsp; &nbsp; 1300&nbsp; &nbsp; 1100&nbsp; &nbsp; 1900&nbsp; &nbsp; 1200&nbsp; &nbsp; 0
<br>Phoenix 1850&nbsp; &nbsp; 1750&nbsp; &nbsp; 2650&nbsp; &nbsp; 1000&nbsp; &nbsp; 800&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2000&nbsp; &nbsp; 2100&nbsp; &nbsp; 0
<br>Seattle 2650&nbsp; &nbsp; 2000&nbsp; &nbsp; 3000&nbsp; &nbsp; 2150&nbsp; &nbsp; 1350&nbsp; &nbsp; 2300&nbsp; &nbsp; 3100&nbsp; &nbsp; 1450&nbsp; &nbsp; 0
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Atlanta Chicago Boston&nbsp; Dallas&nbsp; Denver&nbsp; Detroit Orlando Phoenix Seattle
<br></span><p>The diagonal elements are all zero because that is the distance from a city to itself.  Also, because the distance from A to B is the same as the distance from B to A, there is no need to print the top half of the matrix.</p>

<h3>23.1 Streams</h3>

<p>To get input from a file or send output to a file, you have to create an <span class=code>ifstream</span> object (for input files) or an <span class=code>ofstream</span> object (for output files).  These objects are defined in the header file <span class=code>fstream.h</span>, which you have to include.</p>



<p>A <b>stream</b> is an abstract object that represents the flow of data from a source like the keyboard or a file to a destination like the screen or a file.</p>

<p>We have already worked with two streams: <span class=code>cin</span>, which has type <span class=code>istream</span>, and <span class=code>cout</span>, which has type <span class=code>ostream</span>. <span class=code>cin</span> represents the flow of data from the keyboard to the program.  Each time the program uses the <span class=code>&gt;&gt;</span> operator or the <span class=code>getline</span> function, it removes a piece of data from the input stream.</p>



<p>Similarly, when the program uses the <span class=code>&lt;&lt;</span> operator on an <span class=code>ostream</span>, it adds a datum to the outgoing stream.</p>

<a name=2></a><br>
<h3>23.2 File input</h3>

<p>To get data from a file, we have to create a stream that flows from the file into the program. We can do that using the <span class=code>ifstream</span> constructor.</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; ifstream infile (<span class=quote>"file-name"</span>);
<br></span><p>The argument for this constructor is a string that contains the name of the file you want to open.  The result is an object named <span class=code>infile</span> that supports all the same operations as <span class=code>cin</span>, including <span class=code>&gt;&gt;</span> and <span class=code>getline</span>.</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> x;
<br>&nbsp; pstring line;
<br>
<br>&nbsp; infile &gt;&gt; x;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=comment>// get a single integer and store in x
</span><br>&nbsp; getline (infile, line);&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=comment>// get a whole line and store in line
</span><br></span><p>If we know ahead of time how much data is in a file, it is straightforward to write a loop that reads the entire file and then stops.  More often, though, we want to read the entire file, but don't know how big it is.</p>

<p>There are member functions for <span class=code>ifstreams</span> that check the status of the input stream; they are called <span class=code>good</span>, <span class=code>eof</span>, <span class=code>fail</span> and <span class=code>bad</span>.  We will use <span class=code>good</span> to make sure the file was opened successfully and <span class=code>eof</span> to detect the "end of file."</p>



<p>Whenever you get data from an input stream, you don't know whether the attempt succeeded until you check.  If the return value from <span class=code>eof</span> is <span class=code><span class=keyword>true</span></span> then we have reached the end of the file and we know that the last attempt failed. Here is a program that reads lines from a file and displays them on the screen:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; pstring fileName = ...;
<br>&nbsp; ifstream infile (fileName.c_str());
<br>
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>if</span> (infile.good() == <span class=keyword>false</span>) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>"Unable to open the file named "</span> &lt;&lt; fileName;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; exit (1);
<br>&nbsp; }
<br>
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>while</span> (<span class=keyword>true</span>) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; getline (infile, line);
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>if</span> (infile.eof()) <span class=keyword>break</span>;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; line &lt;&lt; endl;
<br>&nbsp; }
<br></span><p>The function <span class=code>c_str</span> converts an <span class=code>pstring</span> to a native C string.  Because the <span class=code>ifstream</span> constructor expects a C string as an argument, we have to convert the <span class=code>pstring</span>.</p>



<p>Immediately after opening the file, we invoke the <span class=code>good</span> function. The return value is <span class=code><span class=keyword>false</span></span> if the system could not open the file, most likely because it does not exist, or you do not have permission to read it.</p>



<p>The statement <span class=code><span class=keyword>while</span>(<span class=keyword>true</span>)</span> is an idiom for an infinite loop.  Usually there will be a <span class=code><span class=keyword>break</span></span> statement somewhere in the loop so that the program does not really run forever (although some programs do).  In this case, the <span class=code><span class=keyword>break</span></span> statement allows us to exit the loop as soon as we detect the end of file.</p>



<p>It is important to exit the loop between the input statement and the output statement, so that when <span class=code>getline</span> fails at the end of the file, we do not output the invalid data in <span class=code>line</span>.</p>

<a name=3></a><br>
<h3>23.3 File output</h3>

<p>Sending output to a file is similar.  For example, we could modify the previous program to copy lines from one file to another.</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; ifstream infile (<span class=quote>"input-file"</span>);
<br>&nbsp; ofstream outfile (<span class=quote>"output-file"</span>);
<br>
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>if</span> (infile.good() == <span class=keyword>false</span> || outfile.good() == <span class=keyword>false</span>) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>"Unable to open one of the files."</span> &lt;&lt; endl;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; exit (1);
<br>&nbsp; }
<br>
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>while</span> (<span class=keyword>true</span>) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; getline (infile, line);
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>if</span> (infile.eof()) <span class=keyword>break</span>;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; outfile &lt;&lt; line &lt;&lt; endl;
<br>&nbsp; }
<br></span><a name=4></a><br>
<h3>23.4 Parsing input</h3>

<p>In <a href="chap01.htm#4">Section 1.4</a> I defined "parsing" as the process of analyzing the structure of a sentence in a natural language or a statement in a formal language.  For example, the compiler has to parse your program before it can translate it into machine language.</p>

<p>In addition, when you read input from a file or from the keyboard you often have to parse it in order to extract the information you want and detect errors.</p>

<p>For example, I have a file called <span class=code>distances</span> that contains information about the distances between major cities in the United States.  I got this information from a randomly-chosen web page</p>


<p><a href="http://www.jaring.my/usiskl/usa/distance.html">http://www.jaring.my/usiskl/usa/distance.html</a></p><p>so it may be wildly inaccurate, but that doesn't matter.  The format of the file looks like this:</p>


<span class=code><span class=quote>"Atlanta"</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=quote>"Chicago"</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;700
<br><span class=quote>"Atlanta"</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=quote>"Boston"</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,100
<br><span class=quote>"Atlanta"</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=quote>"Chicago"</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;700
<br><span class=quote>"Atlanta"</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=quote>"Dallas"</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 800
<br><span class=quote>"Atlanta"</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=quote>"Denver"</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,450
<br><span class=quote>"Atlanta"</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=quote>"Detroit"</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;750
<br><span class=quote>"Atlanta"</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=quote>"Orlando"</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;400
<br></span><p>Each line of the file contains the names of two cities in quotation marks and the distance between them in miles.  The quotation marks are useful because they make it easy to deal with names that have more than one word, like "San Francisco."</p>

<p>By searching for the quotation marks in a line of input, we can find the beginning and end of each city name. Searching for special characters like quotation marks can be a little awkward, though, because the quotation mark is a special character in C++, used to identify string values.</p>

<p>If we want to find the first ppearance of a quotation mark, we have to write something like:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> index = line.find (<span class=quote>'\"'</span>);
<br></span><p>The argument here looks like a mess, but it represents a single character, a double quotation mark.  The outermost single-quotes indicate that this is a character value, as usual.  The backslash (\verb+\+) indicates that we want to treat the next character literally.  The sequence \verb+\"+ represents a quotation mark; the sequence \verb+\'+ represents a single-quote.  Interestingly, the sequence \verb+<br>+ represents a single backslash.  The first backslash indicates that we should take the second backslash seriously.</p>



<p>Parsing input lines consists of finding the beginning and end of each city name and using the <span class=code>substr</span> function to extract the cities and distance. <span class=code>substr</span> is an <span class=code>pstring</span> member function; it takes two arguments, the starting index of the substring and the length.</p>




<span class=code><span class=keyword>void</span> processLine (<span class=keyword>const</span> pstring& line)
<br>{
<br>&nbsp; <span class=comment>// the character we are looking for is a quotation mark
</span><br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>char</span> quote = <span class=quote>'\"'</span>;
<br>
<br>&nbsp; <span class=comment>// store the indices of the quotation marks in a vector
</span><br>&nbsp; pvector&lt;<span class=keyword>int</span>&gt; quoteIndex (4);
<br>
<br>&nbsp; <span class=comment>// find the first quotation mark using the built-in find
</span><br>&nbsp; quoteIndex[0] = line.find (quote);
<br>
<br>&nbsp; <span class=comment>// find the other quotation marks using the find from Chapter 7
</span><br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>for</span> (<span class=keyword>int</span> i=1; i&lt;4; i++) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; quoteIndex[i] = find (line, quote, quoteIndex[i-1]+1);
<br>&nbsp; }
<br>
<br>&nbsp; <span class=comment>// break the line up into substrings
</span><br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> len1 = quoteIndex[1] - quoteIndex[0] - 1;
<br>&nbsp; pstring city1 = line.substr (quoteIndex[0]+1, len1);
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> len2 = quoteIndex[3] - quoteIndex[2] - 1;
<br>&nbsp; pstring city2 = line.substr (quoteIndex[2]+1, len2);
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> len3 = line.length() - quoteIndex[2] - 1;
<br>&nbsp; pstring distString = line.substr (quoteIndex[3]+1, len3);
<br>
<br>&nbsp; <span class=comment>// output the extracted information
</span><br>&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; city1 &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>"\t"</span> &lt;&lt; city2 &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>"\t"</span> &lt;&lt; distString &lt;&lt; endl;
<br>}
<br></span><p>Of course, just displaying the extracted information is not exactly what we want, but it is a good starting place.</p>

<a name=5></a><br>
<h3>23.5 Parsing numbers</h3>

<p>The next task is to convert the numbers in the file from strings to integers.  When people write large numbers, they often use commas to group the digits, as in 1,750.  Most of the time when computers write large numbers, they don't include commas, and the built-in functions for reading numbers usually can't handle them.  That makes the conversion a little more difficult, but it also provides an opportunity to write a comma-stripping function, so that's ok.  Once we get rid of the commas, we can use the library function <span class=code>atoi</span> to convert to integer.  <span class=code>atoi</span> is defined in the header file <span class=code>stdlib.h</span>.</p>



<p>To get rid of the commas, one option is to traverse the string and check whether each character is a digit.  If so, we add it to the result string.  At the end of the loop, the result string contains all the digits from the original string, in order.</p>


<span class=code><span class=keyword>int</span> convertToInt (<span class=keyword>const</span> pstring& s)
<br>{
<br>&nbsp; pstring digitString = <span class=quote>""</span>;
<br>
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>for</span> (<span class=keyword>int</span> i=0; i&lt;s.length(); i++) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>if</span> (isdigit (s[i])) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; digitString += s[i];
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }
<br>&nbsp; }
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>return</span> atoi (digitString.c_str());
<br>}
<br></span><p>The variable <span class=code>digitString</span> is an example of an <b>accumulator</b>.  It is similar to the counter we saw in <a href="chap07.htm#9">Section 7.9</a>, except that instead of getting incremented, it gets accumulates one new character at a time, using string concatentation.</p>

<p>The expression</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; digitString += s[i];
<br></span><p>is equivalent to</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; digitString = digitString + s[i];
<br></span><p>Both statements add a single character onto the end of the existing string.</p>



<p>Since <span class=code>atoi</span> takes a C string as a parameter, we have to convert <span class=code>digitString</span> to a C string before passing it as an argument.</p>

<a name=6></a><br>
<h3>23.6 The <span class=code>Set</span> data structure</h3>

<p>A data structure is a container for grouping a collection of data into a single object.  We have seen some examples already, including <span class=code>pstring</span>s, which are collections of characters, and <span class=code>pvector</span>s which are collections on any type.</p>

<p>An ordered set is a collection of items with two defining properties:</p>

<dl>

<dt>Ordering</dt>
<dd>The elements of the set have indices associated with them.  We can use these indices to identify elements of the set.</dd>

<dt>Uniqueness</dt>
<dd>No element appears in the set more than once. If you try to add an element to a set, and it already exists, there is no effect.</dd>

</dl>

<p>In addition, our implementation of an ordered set will have the following property:</p>

<dl>

<dt>Arbitrary size</dt>
<dd>As we add elements to the set, it expands to make room for new elements.</dd>

</dl>

<p>Both <span class=code>pstring</span>s and <span class=code>pvector</span>s have an ordering; every element has an index we can use to identify it.  Both none of the data structures we have seen so far have the properties of uniqueness or arbitrary size.</p>



<p>To achieve uniqueness, we have to write an <span class=code>add</span> function that searches the set to see if it already exists.  To make the set expand as elements are added, we can take advantage of the <span class=code>resize</span> function on <span class=code>pvector</span>s.</p>

<p>Here is the beginning of a class definition for a <span class=code>Set</span>.</p>


<span class=code><span class=keyword>class</span> Set {
<br><span class=keyword>private</span>:
<br>&nbsp; pvector&lt;pstring&gt; elements;
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> numElements;
<br>
<br><span class=keyword>public</span>:
<br>&nbsp; Set (<span class=keyword>int</span> n);
<br>
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> getNumElements () <span class=keyword>const</span>;
<br>&nbsp; pstring getElement (<span class=keyword>int</span> i) <span class=keyword>const</span>;
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> find (<span class=keyword>const</span> pstring& s) <span class=keyword>const</span>;
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> add (<span class=keyword>const</span> pstring& s);
<br>};
<br>
<br>Set::Set (<span class=keyword>int</span> n)
<br>{
<br>&nbsp; pvector&lt;pstring&gt; temp (n);
<br>&nbsp; elements = temp;
<br>&nbsp; numElements = 0;
<br>}
<br></span><p>The instance variables are an <span class=code>pvector</span> of strings and an integer that keeps track of how many elements there are in the set.  Keep in mind that the number of elements in the set, <span class=code>numElements</span>, is not the same thing as the size of the <span class=code>pvector</span>.  Usually it will be smaller.</p>



<p>The <span class=code>Set</span> constructor takes a single parameter, which is the initial size of the <span class=code>pvector</span>.  The initial number of elements is always zero.</p>

<p><span class=code>getNumElements</span> and <span class=code>getElement</span> are accessor functions for the instance variables, which are private.  <span class=code>numElements</span> is a read-only variable, so we provide a <span class=code>get</span> function but not a <span class=code>set</span> function.</p>


<span class=code><span class=keyword>int</span> Set::getNumElements () <span class=keyword>const</span>
<br>{
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>return</span> numElements;
<br>}
<br></span><p>Why do we have to prevent client programs from changing <span class=code>getNumElements</span>?  What are the invariants for this type, and how could a client program break an invariant.  As we look at the rest of the <span class=code>Set</span> member function, see if you can convince yourself that they all maintain the invariants.</p>



<p>When we use the <span class=code>[]</span> operator to access the <span class=code>pvector</span>, it checks to make sure the index is greater than or equal to zero and less than the length of the <span class=code>pvector</span>.  To access the elements of a set, though, we need to check a stronger condition. The index has to be less than the number of elements, which might be smaller than the length of the <span class=code>pvector</span>.</p>


<span class=code>pstring Set::getElement (<span class=keyword>int</span> i) <span class=keyword>const</span>
<br>{
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>if</span> (i &lt; numElements) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>return</span> elements[i];
<br>&nbsp; } <span class=keyword>else</span> {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>"Set index out of range."</span> &lt;&lt; endl;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; exit (1);
<br>&nbsp; }
<br>}
<br></span><p>If <span class=code>getElement</span> gets an index that is out of range, it prints an error message (not the most useful message, I admit), and exits.</p>



<p>The interesting functions are <span class=code>find</span> and <span class=code>add</span>.  By now, the pattern for traversing and searching should be old hat:</p>


<span class=code><span class=keyword>int</span> Set::find (<span class=keyword>const</span> pstring& s) <span class=keyword>const</span>
<br>{
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>for</span> (<span class=keyword>int</span> i=0; i&lt;numElements; i++) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>if</span> (elements[i] == s) <span class=keyword>return</span> i;
<br>&nbsp; }
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>return</span> -1;
<br>}
<br></span><p>So that leaves us with <span class=code>add</span>.  Often the return type for something like <span class=code>add</span> would be void, but in this case it might be useful to make it return the index of the element.</p>


<span class=code><span class=keyword>int</span> Set::add (<span class=keyword>const</span> pstring& s)
<br>{
<br>&nbsp; <span class=comment>// if the element is already in the set, return its index
</span><br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> index = find (s);
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>if</span> (index != -1) <span class=keyword>return</span> index;
<br>
<br>&nbsp; <span class=comment>// if the pvector is full, double its size
</span><br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>if</span> (numElements == elements.length()) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; elements.resize (elements.length() * 2);
<br>&nbsp; }
<br>
<br>&nbsp; <span class=comment>// add the new elements and return its index
</span><br>&nbsp; index = numElements;
<br>&nbsp; elements[index] = s;
<br>&nbsp; numElements++;
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>return</span> index;
<br>}
<br></span><p>The tricky thing here is that <span class=code>numElements</span> is used in two ways.  It is the number of elements in the set, of course, but it is also the index of the next element to be added.</p>

<p>It takes a minute to convince yourself that that works, but consider this: when the number of elements is zero, the index of the next element is 0.  When the number of elements is equal to the length of the <span class=code>pvector</span>, that means that the vector is full, and we have to allocate more space (using <span class=code>resize</span>) before we can add the new element.</p>



<p>Here is a state diagram showing a <span class=code>Set</span> object that initially contains space for 2 elements.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/set.png"></p>

<p>Now we can use the <span class=code>Set</span> class to keep track of the cities we find in the file.  In <span class=code>main</span> we create the <span class=code>Set</span> with an initial size of 2:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; Set cities (2);
<br></span><p>Then in <span class=code>processLine</span> we add both cities to the <span class=code>Set</span> and store the index that gets returned.</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> index1 = cities.add (city1);
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> index2 = cities.add (city2);
<br></span><p>I modified <span class=code>processLine</span> to take the <span class=code>cities</span> object as a second parameter.</p>

<h3>23.7 <span class=code>pmatrix</span></h3>

<p>An <span class=code>pmatrix</span> is similar to an <span class=code>pvector</span> except it is two-dimensional.  Instead of a length, it has two dimensions, called <span class=code>numrows</span> and <span class=code>numcols</span>, for "number of rows" and "number of columns."</p>

<p>Each element in the matrix is indentified by two indices; one specifies the row number, the other the column number.</p>



<p>To create a matrix, there are four constructors:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; pmatrix&lt;<span class=keyword>char</span>&gt; m1;
<br>&nbsp; pmatrix&lt;<span class=keyword>int</span>&gt; m2 (3, 4);
<br>&nbsp; pmatrix&lt;<span class=keyword>double</span>&gt; m3 (rows, cols, 0.0);
<br>&nbsp; pmatrix&lt;<span class=keyword>double</span>&gt; m4 (m3);
<br></span><p>The first is a do-nothing constructor that makes a matrix with both dimensions 0.  The second takes two integers, which are the initial number of rows and columns, in that order.  The third is the same as the second, except that it takes an additional parameter that is used to initialized the elements of the matrix.  The fourth is a copy constructor that takes another <span class=code>pmatrix</span> as a parameter.</p>



<p>Just as with <span class=code>pvectors</span>, we can make <span class=code>pmatrix</span>es with any type of elements (including <span class=code>pvector</span>s, and even <span class=code>pmatrix</span>es).</p>

<p>To access the elements of a matrix, we use the <span class=code>[]</span> operator to specify the row and column:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; m2[0][0] = 1;
<br>&nbsp; m3[1][2] = 10.0 * m2[0][0];
<br></span><p>If we try to access an element that is out of range, the program prints an error message and quits.</p>



<p>The <span class=code>numrows</span> and <span class=code>numcols</span> functions get the number of rows and columns.  Remember that the row indices run from 0 to <span class=code>numrows() -1</span> and the column indices run from 0 to <span class=code>numcols() -1</span>.</p>



<p>The usual way to traverse a matrix is with a nested loop. This loop sets each element of the matrix to the sum of its two indices:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>for</span> (<span class=keyword>int</span> row=0; row &lt; m2.numrows(); row++) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>for</span> (<span class=keyword>int</span> col=0; col &lt; m2.numcols(); col++) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; m2[row][col] = row + col;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }
<br>&nbsp; }
<br></span><p>This loop prints each row of the matrix with tabs between the elements and newlines between the rows:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>for</span> (<span class=keyword>int</span> row=0; row &lt; m2.numrows(); row++) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>for</span> (<span class=keyword>int</span> col=0; col &lt; m2.numcols(); col++) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; m2[row][col] &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>"\t"</span>;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; endl;
<br>&nbsp; }
<br></span><a name=8></a><br>
<h3>23.8 A distance matrix</h3>

<p>Finally, we are ready to put the data from the file into a matrix.  Specifically, the matrix will have one row and one column for each city.</p>

<p>We'll create the matrix in <span class=code>main</span>, with plenty of space to spare:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; pmatrix&lt;<span class=keyword>int</span>&gt; distances (50, 50, 0);
<br></span><p>Inside <span class=code>processLine</span>, we add new information to the matrix by getting the indices of the two cities from the <span class=code>Set</span> and using them as matrix indices:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> dist = convertToInt (distString);
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> index1 = cities.add (city1);
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> index2 = cities.add (city2);
<br>
<br>&nbsp; distances[index1][index2] = distance;
<br>&nbsp; distances[index2][index1] = distance;
<br></span><p>Finally, in <span class=code>main</span> we can print the information in a human-readable form:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>for</span> (<span class=keyword>int</span> i=0; i&lt;cities.getNumElements(); i++) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; cities.getElement(i) &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>"\t"</span>;
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>for</span> (<span class=keyword>int</span> j=0; j&lt;=i; j++) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; distances[i][j] &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>"\t"</span>;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; endl;
<br>&nbsp; }
<br>
<br>&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>"\t"</span>;
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>for</span> (<span class=keyword>int</span> i=0; i&lt;cities.getNumElements(); i++) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; cities.getElement(i) &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>"\t"</span>;
<br>&nbsp; }
<br>&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; endl;

<h3>23.9 A proper distance matrix</h3>

<p>Although this code works, it is not as well organized as it should be.  Now that we have written a prototype, we are in a good position to evaluate the design and improve it.</p>

<p>What are some of the problems with the existing code?</p>

<ol>

<li>We did not know ahead of time how big to make the distance matrix, so we chose an arbitrary large number (50) and made it a fixed size.  It would be better to allow the distance matrix to expand in the same way a <span class=code>Set</span> does.  The <span class=code>pmatrix</span> class has a function called <span class=code>resize</span> that makes this possible.</li>



<li>The data in the distance matrix is not well-encapsulated. We have to pass the set of city names and the matrix itself as arguments to <span class=code>processLine</span>, which is awkward.  Also, use of the distance matrix is error prone because we have not provided accessor functions that perform error-checking. It might be a good idea to take the <span class=code>Set</span> of city names and the <span class=code>pmatrix</span> of distances, and combine them into a single object called a <span class=code>DistMatrix</span>.</li>

</ol>

<p>Here is a draft of what the header for a <span class=code>DistMatrix</span> might look like:</p>


<span class=code><span class=keyword>class</span> DistMatrix {
<br><span class=keyword>private</span>:
<br>&nbsp; Set cities;
<br>&nbsp; pmatrix&lt;<span class=keyword>int</span>&gt; distances;
<br>
<br><span class=keyword>public</span>:
<br>&nbsp; DistMatrix (<span class=keyword>int</span> rows);
<br>
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>void</span> add (<span class=keyword>const</span> pstring& city1, <span class=keyword>const</span> pstring& city2, <span class=keyword>int</span> dist);
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> distance (<span class=keyword>int</span> i, <span class=keyword>int</span> j) <span class=keyword>const</span>;
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> distance (<span class=keyword>const</span> pstring& city1, <span class=keyword>const</span> pstring& city2) <span class=keyword>const</span>;
<br>&nbsp; pstring cityName (<span class=keyword>int</span> i) <span class=keyword>const</span>;
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> numCities () <span class=keyword>const</span>;
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>void</span> print ();
<br>};
<br></span><p>Using this interface simplifies <span class=code>main</span>:</p>


<span class=code><span class=keyword>void</span> main ()
<br>{
<br>&nbsp; pstring line;
<br>&nbsp; ifstream infile (<span class=quote>"distances"</span>);
<br>&nbsp; DistMatrix distances (2);
<br>
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>while</span> (<span class=keyword>true</span>) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; getline (infile, line);
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>if</span> (infile.eof()) <span class=keyword>break</span>;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; processLine (line, distances);
<br>&nbsp; }
<br>
<br>&nbsp; distances.print ();
<br>}
<br></span><p>It also simplifies <span class=code>processLine</span>:</p>


<span class=code><span class=keyword>void</span> processLine (<span class=keyword>const</span> pstring& line, DistMatrix& distances)
<br>{
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>char</span> quote = <span class=quote>'\"'</span>;
<br>&nbsp; pvector&lt;<span class=keyword>int</span>&gt; quoteIndex (4);
<br>&nbsp; quoteIndex[0] = line.find (quote);
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>for</span> (<span class=keyword>int</span> i=1; i&lt;4; i++) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; quoteIndex[i] = find (line, quote, quoteIndex[i-1]+1);
<br>&nbsp; }
<br>
<br>&nbsp; <span class=comment>// break the line up into substrings
</span><br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> len1 = quoteIndex[1] - quoteIndex[0] - 1;
<br>&nbsp; pstring city1 = line.substr (quoteIndex[0]+1, len1);
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> len2 = quoteIndex[3] - quoteIndex[2] - 1;
<br>&nbsp; pstring city2 = line.substr (quoteIndex[2]+1, len2);
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> len3 = line.length() - quoteIndex[2] - 1;
<br>&nbsp; pstring distString = line.substr (quoteIndex[3]+1, len3);
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> distance = convertToInt (distString);
<br>
<br>&nbsp; <span class=comment>// add the new datum to the distances matrix
</span><br>&nbsp; distances.add (city1, city2, distance);
<br>}
<br></span><p>I will leave it as an exercise to you to implement the member functions of <span class=code>DistMatrix</span>.</p>
