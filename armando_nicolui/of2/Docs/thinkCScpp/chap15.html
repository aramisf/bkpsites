<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<h1>Object-oriented programming</h1>
 <b>Jonah Cohen</b>

<a name=1></a><br>
<h3>15.1 Programming languages and styles</h3>

<p>There are many programming languages in the world, and almost as many programming styles (sometimes called paradigms).  Three styles that have appeared in this book are procedural, functional, and object-oriented.  Although C++ is usually thought of as an object-oriented language, it is possible to write C++ programs in any style.  The style I have demonstrated in this book is pretty much procedural.  Existing C++ programs and C++ system libraries are written in a mixture of all three styles, but they tend to be more object-oriented than the programs in this book.</p>

<p>It's not easy to define what object-oriented programming is, but here are some of its characteristics:</p>

<ul>

<li>Object definitions (classes) usually correspond to relevant real-world objects.  For example, in <a href="chap13.htm#3">Chapter 13.3</a>, the creation of the <span class=code>Deck</span> class was a step toward object-oriented programming.</li>

<li>The majority of functions are member functions (the kind you invoke on an object) rather than nonmember functions (the kind you just invoke).  So far all the functions we have written have been nonmember functions.  In this chapter we will write some member functions.</li>

<li>The language feature most associated with object-oriented programming is <b>inheritance</b>.  I will cover inheritance later in this chapter.</li>

</ul>

<p>Recently object-oriented programming has become quite popular, and there are people who claim that it is superior to other styles in various ways.  I hope that by exposing you to a variety of styles I have given you the tools you need to understand and evaluate these claims.</p>

<a name=2></a><br>
<h3>15.2 Member and nonmember functions</h3>

<p>There are two types of functions in C++, called <b>nonmember functions</b> and <b>member functions</b>.  So far, every function we have written has been a nonmember function.  Member functions are declared inside class defintions. Any function declared outside of a class is a nonmember function.</p>

<p>Although we have not written any member functions, we have invoked some. Whenever you invoke a function "on" an object, it's a member function. Also, the functions we invoked on <span class=code>pstring</span>s in <a href="chap07.html">Chapter 7</a> were member functions.</p>



<p>Anything that can be written as a nonmember function can also be written as a member function, and vice versa.  Sometimes it is just more natural to use one or the other.  For reasons that will be clear soon, member functions are often shorter than the corresponding nonmember functions.</p>

<a name=3></a><br>
<h3>15.3 The current object</h3>

<p>When you invoke a function on an object, that object becomes <b>the current object</b>.  Inside the function, you can refer to the instance variables of the current object by name, without having to specify the name of the object.</p>



<p>You can also refer to the current object through the keyword <span class=code><span class=keyword>this</span></span>. We have already seen <span class=code><span class=keyword>this</span></span> in an assignment operator in <a href="chap11.htm#2">Section 11.2</a>. However, the <span class=code><span class=keyword>this</span></span> keyword is implicit most of the time, so you will rarely find any need for it.</p>

<a name=4></a><br>
<h3>15.4 Complex numbers</h3>

<p>Continuing the example from the previous chapter, we will consider a class definition for complex numbers.  Complex numbers are useful for many branches of mathematics and engineering, and many computations are performed using complex arithmetic.  A complex number is the sum of a real part and an imaginary part, and is usually written in the form <tt>x + yi</tt>, where <tt>x</tt> is the real part, <tt>y</tt> is the imaginary part, and <tt>i</tt> represents the square root of -1. Thus, <tt>i &middot; i = -1</tt>.</p>

<p>The following is a class definition for a new object type called <span class=code>Complex</span>:</p>


<span class=code><span class=keyword>class</span> Complex
<br>{
<br><span class=keyword>private</span>:
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>double</span> real, imag;
<br>
<br><span class=keyword>public</span>:
<br>&nbsp; Complex () {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; real = 0.0;&nbsp; imag = 0.0;
<br>&nbsp; }
<br>
<br>&nbsp; Complex (<span class=keyword>double</span> r, <span class=keyword>double</span> i) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; real = r;&nbsp; imag = i;
<br>&nbsp; }
<br>};
<br></span><p>There should be nothing surprising here.  The instance variables are two <span class=code><span class=keyword>double</span></span>s that contain the real and imaginary parts. The two constructors are the usual kind: one takes no parameters and assigns default values to the instance variables, the other takes parameters that are identical to the instance variables.</p>



<p>In <span class=code>main</span>, or anywhere else we want to create <span class=code>Complex</span> objects, we have the option of creating the object and then setting the instance variables, or doing both at the same time:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; &nbsp; Complex x;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; x.real = 1.0;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; x.imag = 2.0;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Complex y (3.0, 4.0);
<br></span><a name=5></a><br>
<h3>15.5 A function on <span class=code>Complex</span> numbers</h3>

<p>Let's look at some of the operations we might want to perform on complex numbers.  The absolute value of a complex number is defined to be <tt>sqrt(x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>)</tt>.  The <span class=code>abs</span> function is a pure function that computes the absolute value.  Written as a nonmember function, it looks like this:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; <span class=comment>// nonmember function
</span><br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>double</span> abs (Complex c) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>return</span> sqrt (c.real * c.real + c.imag * c.imag);
<br>&nbsp; }
<br></span><p>This version of <span class=code>abs</span> calculates the absolute value of <span class=code>c</span>, the <span class=code>Complex</span> object it receives as a parameter.  The next version of <span class=code>abs</span> is a member function; it calculates the absolute value of the current object (the object the function was invoked on).  Thus, it does not receive any parameters:</p>


<span class=code><span class=keyword>class</span> Complex
<br>{
<br><span class=keyword>private</span>:
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>double</span> real, image;
<br>
<br><span class=keyword>public</span>:
<br>&nbsp; <span class=comment>// ...constructors
</span><br>
<br>&nbsp; <span class=comment>// member function
</span><br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>double</span> abs () {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>return</span> sqrt (real*real + imag*imag);
<br>&nbsp; }
<br>};
<br></span><p>I removed the unnecessary parameter to indicate that this is a member function.  Inside the function, I can refer to the instance variables <span class=code>real</span> and <span class=code>imag</span> by name without having to specify an object. C++ knows implicitly that I am referring to the instance variables of the current object.  If I wanted to make it explicit, I could have used the keyword <span class=code><span class=keyword>this</span></span>:</p>


<span class=code><span class=keyword>class</span> Complex
<br>{
<br><span class=keyword>private</span>:
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>double</span> real, image;
<br>
<br><span class=keyword>public</span>:
<br>&nbsp; <span class=comment>// ...constructors
</span><br>
<br>&nbsp; <span class=comment>// member function
</span><br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>double</span> abs () {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>return</span> sqrt (<span class=keyword>this</span>-&gt;real * <span class=keyword>this</span>-&gt;real + <span class=keyword>this</span>-&gt;imag * <span class=keyword>this</span>-&gt;imag);
<br>&nbsp; }
<br>};
<br></span><p>But that would be longer and not really any clearer.  To invoke this function, we invoke it on an object, for example</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; &nbsp; Complex y (3.0, 4.0);
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>double</span> result = y.abs ();
<br></span><a name=6></a><br>
<h3>15.6 Another function on <span class=code>Complex</span> numbers</h3>

<p>Another operation we might want to perform on complex numbers is addition.  You can add complex numbers by adding the real parts and adding the imaginary parts.  Written as a nonmember function, that looks like:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; Complex Add (Complex& a, Complex& b) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>return</span> Complex (a.real + b.real, a.imag + b.imag);
<br>&nbsp; }
<br></span><p>To invoke this function, we would pass both operands as arguments:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; &nbsp; Complex sum = Add (x, y);
<br></span><p>Written as a member function, it would take only one argument, which it would add to the current object:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; Complex Add (Complex& b) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>return</span> Complex (real + b.real, imag + b.imag);
<br>&nbsp; }
<br></span><p>Again, we can refer to the instance variables of the current object implicitly, but to refer to the instance variables of <span class=code>b</span> we have to name <span class=code>b</span> explicitly using dot notation. To invoke this function, you invoke it on one of the operands and pass the other as an argument.</p>




<span class=code>&nbsp; &nbsp; Complex sum = x.Add (y);
<br></span><p>From these examples you can see that the current object (<span class=code><span class=keyword>this</span></span>) can take the place of one of the parameters.  For this reason, the current object is sometimes called an <b>implicit</b> parameter.</p>

<a name=7></a><br>
<h3>15.7 A modifier</h3>

<p>As yet another example, we'll look at <span class=code>conjugate</span>, which is a modifier function that transforms a <span class=code>Complex</span> number into its complex conjugate.  The complex conjugate of <tt>x + yi</tt> is <tt>x - yi</tt>.</p>

<p>As a nonmember function, this looks like:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>void</span> conjugate (Complex& c) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; c.imag = -c.imag;
<br>&nbsp; }
<br></span><p>As a member function, it looks like</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>void</span> conjugate () {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; imag = -imag;
<br>&nbsp; }
<br></span><p>By now you should be getting the sense that converting a function from one kind to another is a mechanical process.  With a little practice, you will be able to do it without giving it much thought, which is good because you should not be constrained to writing one kind of function or the other.  You should be equally familiar with both so that you can choose whichever one seems most appropriate for the operation you are writing.</p>

<p>For example, I think that <span class=code>Add</span> should be written as a nonmember function because it is a symmetric operation of two operands, and it makes sense for both operands to appear as parameters.  It just seems odd to invoke the function on one of the operands and pass the other as an argument.  (Actually, in the next section you'll learn of a method called <b>operator overloading</b> which eliminates the need for explicitly calling functions like <span class=code>Add</span>.)</p>

<p>On the other hand, simple operations that apply to a single object can be written most concisely as member functions (even if they take some additional arguments).</p>

<a name=8></a><br>
<h3>15.8 Operator overloading and <span class=code>&lt;&lt;</span></h3>

<p>There are two operators that are common to many object types: <span class=code>&lt;&lt;</span> and <span class=code>=</span>.  <span class=code>&lt;&lt;</span> converts the object to some reasonable string representation so it can be outputted, and <span class=code>=</span> is used to copy objects.</p>

<p>When you output an object using <span class=code>cout</span>, C++ checks to see whether you have provided a <span class=code>&lt;&lt;</span> definition for that object.  If it can't find one, it will refuse to compile and give an error such as</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; complex.cpp:11: no match <span class=keyword>for</span> `_IO_ostream_withassign & &lt;&lt; Complex &'
<br></span><p>Here is what <span class=code>&lt;&lt;</span> might look like for the <span class=code>Complex</span> class:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; ostream& <span class=keyword>operator</span> &lt;&lt; (ostream& os, Complex& num) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; os &lt;&lt; num.real &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>" + "</span> &lt;&lt; num.imag &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>"i"</span>;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>return</span> os;
<br>&nbsp; }
<br></span><p>Whenever you pass an object to an output stream such as <span class=code>cout</span>, C++ invokes the <span class=code>&lt;&lt;</span> operator on that object and outputs the result. In this case, the output is <span class=code>1 + 2i</span>.</p>

<p>The return type for <span class=code>&lt;&lt;</span> is <span class=code>ostream&</span>, which is the datatype of a <span class=code>cout</span> object.  By returning the <span class=code>os</span> object (which, like <span class=code>ostream</span>, is just an abbreviation of output stream), you can string together multiple <span class=code>&lt;&lt;</span> commands such as</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>"Your two numbers are "</span> &lt;&lt; num1 &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>" and "</span> &lt;&lt; num2;
<br></span><p>To illustrate why that's a good thing, consider what you would be forced to do if you didn't return the ostream object:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>"Your two numbers are "</span>;
<br>&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; num1;
<br>&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>" and "</span>;
<br>&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; num2;
<br></span><p>Because the first example allows stringing <span class=code>&lt;&lt;</span> statements together, all the display code fits easily on one line.  The output from both statements is the same, displaying "Your two numbers are 3 + 2i and 1 + 5i".</p>

<p>This version of <span class=code>&lt;&lt;</span> does not look good if the imaginary part is negative.  As an exercise, fix it.</p>

<a name=9></a><br>
<h3>15.9 The <span class=code>=</span> operator</h3>

<p>Unlike the <span class=code>&lt;&lt;</span> operator, which refuses to output classes that haven't defined their own definition of that function, every class comes with its own <span class=code>=</span>, or assignment, operator. This default operator simply copies every data member from one class instance to the other by using the <span class=code>=</span> operator on each member variable.</p>

<p>When you create a new object type, you can provide your own definition of <span class=code>=</span> by including a member function called <span class=code><span class=keyword>operator</span> =</span>.  For the <span class=code>Complex</span> class, this looks like:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>const</span> Complex& <span class=keyword>operator</span> = (Complex& b) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; real = b.real;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; imag = b.imag;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>return</span> *<span class=keyword>this</span>;
<br>&nbsp; }
<br></span><p>By convention, <span class=code>=</span> is always a member function.  It returns the current object.  (Remember <span class=code><span class=keyword>this</span></span> from <a href="chap11.htm#2">Section 11.2</a>?) This is similar to how <span class=code>&lt;&lt;</span> returns the ostream object, because it allows you to string together several <span class=code>=</span> statements:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; Complex a, b, c;
<br>&nbsp; c.real = 1.0;
<br>&nbsp; c.imag = 2.0;
<br>&nbsp; a = b = c;
<br></span><p>In the above example, c is copied to b, and then b is copied to a. The result is that all three variables contain the data originally stored in c.  While not used as often as stringing together <span class=code>&lt;&lt;</span> statements, this is still a useful feature of C++.</p>

<p>The purpose of the <span class=code><span class=keyword>const</span></span> in the return type is to prevent assignments such as:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; (a = b) = c;
<br></span><p>This is a tricky statement, because you may think it should just assign c to a and b like the earlier example.  However, in this case the parentheses actually mean that the <i>result</i> of the statement <span class=code>a = b</span> is being assigned a new value, which would actually assign it to a and bypass b altogether.  By making the return type <span class=code><span class=keyword>const</span></span>, we prevent this from happening.</p>

<a name=10></a><br>
<h3>15.10 Invoking one member function from another</h3>

<p>As you might expect, it is legal and common to invoke one member function from another.  For example, to normalize a complex number, you divide through (both parts) by the absolute value.  It may not be obvious why this is useful, but it is.</p>

<p>Let's write the function <span class=code>normalize</span> as a member function, and let's make it a modifier.</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>void</span> normalize () {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>double</span> d = <span class=keyword>this</span>-&gt;abs();
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; real = real/d;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; imag = imag/d;
<br>&nbsp; }
<br></span><p>The first line finds the absolute value of the current object by invoking <span class=code>abs</span> on the current object.  In this case I named the current object explicitly, but I could have left it out.  If you invoke one member function within another, C++ assumes that you are invoking it on the current object.</p>

<p>As an exercise, rewrite <span class=code>normalize</span> as a pure function. Then rewrite it as a nonmember function.</p>

<a name=11></a><br>
<h3>15.11 Oddities and errors</h3>

<p>If you have both member functions and nonmember functions in the same class definition, it is easy to get confused.  A common way to organize a class definition is to put all the constructors at the beginning, followed by all the member functions and then all the nonmember functions.</p>

<p>You can have a member function and a nonmember function with the same name, as long as they do not have the same number and types of parameters.  As with other kinds of overloading, C++ decides which version to invoke by looking at the arguments you provide.</p>



<p>Since there is no current object in a nonmember function, it is an error to use the keyword <span class=code><span class=keyword>this</span></span>.  If you try, you might get an error message like: "Undefined variable: this."  Also, you cannot refer to instance variables without using dot notation and providing an object name.  If you try, you might get "Can't make a static reference to nonstatic variable..." This is not one of the better error messages, since it uses some non-standard language.  For example, by "nonstatic variable" it means "instance variable."  But once you know what it means, you know what it means.</p>

<a name=12></a><br>
<h3>15.12 Inheritance</h3>

<p>The language feature that is most often associated with object-oriented programming is <b>inheritance</b>.  Inheritance is the ability to define a new class that is a modified version of a previously-defined class (including built-in classes).</p>

<p>The primary advantage of this feature is that you can add new functions or instance variables to an existing class without modifying the existing class.  This is particularly useful for built-in classes, since you can't modify them even if you want to.</p>

<p>The reason inheritance is called "inheritance" is that the new class inherits all the instance variables and functions of the existing class.  Extending this metaphor, the existing class is sometimes called the <b>parent</b> class and the new class is called the <b>subclass</b>.</p>

<a name=13></a><br>
<h3>15.13 Message class</h3>

<p>An an example of inheritance, we are going to take a message class and create a subclass of error messages. That is, we are going to create a new class called <span class=code>ErrorMessage</span> that will have all the instance variables and functions of a <span class=code>Message</span>, plus an additional member variable, <span class=code>errorCode</span>, which will be displayed when the object is outputted.</p>

<p>The <span class=code>Message</span> class definition looks like this:</p>


<span class=code><span class=keyword>class</span> Message
<br>{
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>protected</span>:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; pstring source;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=comment>//source of message
</span><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; pstring message;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=comment>//text in message
</span><br>
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>public</span>:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=comment>//constructor
</span><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Message(<span class=keyword>const</span> pstring& src, <span class=keyword>const</span> pstring& msg) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; source = src;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=comment>//initialize source
</span><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; message = msg;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=comment>//initialize message
</span><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=comment>//convert message to pstring
</span><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>virtual</span> pstring getMessage() <span class=keyword>const</span> {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>return</span> source + <span class=quote>": "</span> + message;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }
<br>};
<br></span><p>And that's all there is in the whole class definition.  A <span class=code>Message</span> has two protected member variables: the source of the message and the text of the message.  The constructor initializes these member variables from the two <span class=code>pstring</span>s passed as arguments.</p>



<p>You probably noticed that there is a <span class=code><span class=keyword>const</span></span> floating in free-space after the <span class=code>getMessage</span> function declaration.  When variables are declared <span class=code><span class=keyword>const</span></span> (such as in the <span class=code>Message</span> constructor), it indicates that the function can't modify their values.  However, a <span class=code><span class=keyword>const</span></span> after a function declaration means that the function itself is <span class=code><span class=keyword>const</span></span>!  Only member functions can use this feature, because what it means is that the function can't modify any member variables of its class.  Think of it as if <span class=code>*<span class=keyword>this</span></span> is marked <span class=code><span class=keyword>const</span></span>.</p>

<p>The <span class=code><span class=keyword>virtual</span></span> indicator at the beginning of <span class=code>getMessage</span> is a very important feature of inheritance.  When a function is marked <span class=code><span class=keyword>virtual</span></span>, it allows that function to be redefined in subclasses. We will use this feature to change the behavior of <span class=code>getMessage</span> in the <span class=code>ErrorMessage</span> class.</p>

<p>Now here is an example of an <span class=code>ErrorMessage</span> class which extends the functionality of a basic <span class=code>Message</span>:</p>


<span class=code><span class=keyword>class</span> ErrorMessage : <span class=keyword>public</span> Message
<br>{
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>protected</span>:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; pstring errorCode;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=comment>//error messages have error codes
</span><br>
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>public</span>:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=comment>//constructor
</span><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; ErrorMessage(<span class=keyword>const</span> pstring& ec, <span class=keyword>const</span> pstring& src, <span class=keyword>const</span> pstring& msg) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; errorCode = ec;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=comment>//initialize error code
</span><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; source = src;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=comment>//initialize source
</span><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; message = msg;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=comment>//initialize message
</span><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=comment>//convert message to pstring
</span><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>virtual</span> pstring getMessage() <span class=keyword>const</span> {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>return</span> <span class=quote>"ERROR "</span> + errorCode + <span class=quote>": "</span> + source + <span class=quote>": "</span> + message;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }
<br>};
<br></span><p>The class declaration indicates that <span class=code>ErrorMessage</span> inherits from <span class=code>Message</span>.  A colon followed by the keyword <span class=code><span class=keyword>public</span></span> is used to identify the parent class.</p>

<p>The <span class=code>ErrorMessage</span> class has one additional member variable for an error code, which is added to the string returned from the <span class=code>getMessage</span> function.  It would serve to notify a user of the error code associated with whatever message they received.  The constructor of <span class=code>ErrorMessage</span> initializes both the original member variables, <span class=code>source</span> and <span class=code>message</span>, and the new <span class=code>errorCode</span> variable.</p>

<p>An important thing to note is that the <span class=code>getMessage</span> function has been redefined in <span class=code>ErrorMessage</span>.  Now the returned string includes the error code of the message.  Suppose we want to overload the <span class=code>&lt;&lt;</span> operator to call <span class=code>getMessage</span> in order to display messages.</p>


<span class=code>ostream& <span class=keyword>operator</span> &lt;&lt; (ostream& os, <span class=keyword>const</span> Message& msg) {
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>return</span> os &lt;&lt; msg.getMessage();
<br>}
<br></span><p>This function will take any <span class=code>Message</span> object and display it by calling its <span class=code>getMessage</span> function.  Since the <span class=code>ErrorMessage</span> class is inherited from the <span class=code>Message</span> class, what that means is that every <span class=code>ErrorMessage</span> object is also a <span class=code>Message</span> object! This allows you to use <span class=code>displayMessage</span> like this:</p>


<span class=code>ErrorMessage error (<span class=quote>"1234"</span>, <span class=quote>"Hard drive"</span>, <span class=quote>"Out of space"</span>);
<br>cout &lt;&lt; error &lt;&lt; endl;
<br></span><p>The code first creates an <span class=code>ErrorMessage</span> object with three strings for the source, message, and error code.  Then the error message is passed to <span class=code>&lt;&lt;</span>.  Inside <span class=code>&lt;&lt;</span>, the <span class=code>Message</span> object's <span class=code>getMessage</span> function is called in order to get a string representation of the object for output.  The resulting output is:</p>


<span class=code>ERROR 1234: Hard drive: Out of space
<br></span><p>Even though the function thinks the object is a <span class=code>Message</span>, and has probably never even heard of the <span class=code>ErrorMessage</span> class, it is still calling a function defined in <span class=code>ErrorMessage</span>.  This is all because of the <span class=code><span class=keyword>virtual</span></span> keyword used in the <span class=code>getMessage</span> declaration. All functions that are ever going to be redefined in subclasses <i>must</i> be declared virtual.  Otherwise, <span class=code>&lt;&lt;</span> would not realize the object is an <span class=code>ErrorMessage</span> and would go ahead and call the <span class=code>getMessage</span> defined in <span class=code>Message</span> instead.</p>

<p>As an excercise, remove the <span class=code><span class=keyword>virtual</span></span>s and recompile the program. See if you can predict the output before running it.</p>

<h3>15.14 Object-oriented design</h3>

<p>Inheritance is a powerful feature.  Some programs that would be complicated without inheritance can be written concisely and simply with it.  Also, inheritance can facilitate code reuse, since you can customize the behavior of build-in classes without having to modify them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, inheritance can make programs difficult to read, since it is sometimes not clear, when a function is invoked, where to find the definition.  For example, in a GUI environment you could call the <span class=code>Redraw</span> function on a <span class=code>Scrollbar</span> object, yet that particular function was defined in <span class=code>WindowObject</span>, the parent of the parent of the parent of the parent of <span class=code>Scrollbar</span>.</p>

<p>Also, many of the things that can be done using inheritance can be done almost as elegantly (or more so) without it.</p>

<h3>15.15 Glossary</h3>

<dl>

<dt>dot notation</dt>
<dd>The method C++ uses to refer to member variables and functions.  The format is <span class=code>className.memberName</span>.</dd>

<dt>member function</dt>
<dd>A function that is declared within the class defintion of an object.  It is invoked directly on an object using dot notation.</dd>

<dt>nonmember function</dt>
<dd>A function defined outside any class defintion. Nonmember functions are not invoked on objects and they do not have a current object.</dd>

<dt>current object</dt>
<dd>The object on which a member function is invoked.  Inside the function, the current object is referred to by the pointer <span class=code><span class=keyword>this</span></span>.</dd>

<dt><span class=code><span class=keyword>this</span></span></dt>
<dd>The keyword that refers to a pointer to the current object.</dd>

<dt><span class=code><span class=keyword>virtual</span></span></dt>
<dd>The keyword that is used by any function defined in a parent class that can be overloaded in subclasses.</dd>

<dt>implicit</dt>
<dd>Anything that is left unsaid or implied.  Within a member function, you can refer to the instance variables implicitly (without naming the object).</dd>

<dt>explicit</dt>
<dd>Anything that is spelled out completely.  Within a nonmember function, all references to the instance variables have to be explicit.</dd>
