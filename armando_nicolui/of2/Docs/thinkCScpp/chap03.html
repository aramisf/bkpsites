<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<h1>Function</h1>


<a name=1></a><br>
<h3>3.1 Floating-point</h3>

<p>In the last chapter we had some problems dealing with numbers that were not integers.  We worked around the problem by measuring percentages instead of fractions, but a more general solution is to use floating-point numbers, which can represent fractions as well as integers.  In C++, there are two floating-point types, called <span class=code><span class=keyword>float</span></span> and <span class=code><span class=keyword>double</span></span>.  In this book we will use <span class=code><span class=keyword>double</span></span>s exclusively.</p>

<p>You can create floating-point variables and assign values to them using the same syntax we used for the other types.  For example:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>double</span> pi;
<br>&nbsp; pi = 3.14159;
<br></span><p>It is also legal to declare a variable and assign a value to it at the same time:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> x = 1;
<br>&nbsp; String empty = <span class=quote>""</span>;
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>double</span> pi = 3.14159;
<br></span><p>In fact, this syntax is quite common.  A combined declaration and assignment is sometimes called an <b>initialization</b>.</p>



<p>Although floating-point numbers are useful, they are often a source of confusion because there seems to be an overlap between integers and floating-point numbers.  For example, if you have the value <span class=code>1</span>, is that an integer, a floating-point number, or both?</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, C++ distinguishes the integer value <span class=code>1</span> from the floating-point value <span class=code>1.0</span>, even though they seem to be the same number.  They belong to different types, and strictly speaking, you are not allowed to make assignments between types.  For example, the following is illegal</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> x = 1.1;
<br></span><p>because the variable on the left is an <span class=code><span class=keyword>int</span></span> and the value on the right is a <span class=code><span class=keyword>double</span></span>.  But it is easy to forget this rule, especially because there are places where C++ automatically converts from one type to another. For example,</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>double</span> y = 1;
<br></span><p>should technically not be legal, but C++ allows it by converting the <span class=code><span class=keyword>int</span></span> to a <span class=code><span class=keyword>double</span></span> automatically.  This leniency is convenient, but it can cause problems; for example:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>double</span> y = 1 / 3;
<br></span><p>You might expect the variable <span class=code>y</span> to be given the value <span class=code>0.333333</span>, which is a legal floating-point value, but in fact it will get the value <span class=code>0.0</span>.  The reason is that the expression on the right appears to be the ratio of two integers, so C++ does <i>integer</i> division, which yields the integer value <span class=code>0</span>.  Converted to floating-point, the result is <span class=code>0.0</span>.</p>

<p>One way to solve this problem (once you figure out what it is) is to make the right-hand side a floating-point expression:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>double</span> y = 1.0 / 3.0;
<br></span><p>This sets <span class=code>y</span> to <span class=code>0.333333</span>, as expected.</p>



<p>All the operations we have seen---addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division---work on floating-point values, although you might be interested to know that the underlying mechanism is completely different.  In fact, most processors have special hardware just for performing floating-point operations.</p>

<a name=2></a><br>
<h3>3.2 Converting from <span class=code><span class=keyword>double</span></span> to <span class=code><span class=keyword>int</span></span></h3>

<p>As I mentioned, C++ converts <span class=code><span class=keyword>int</span></span>s to <span class=code><span class=keyword>double</span></span>s automatically if necessary, because no information is lost in the translation.  On the other hand, going from a <span class=code><span class=keyword>double</span></span> to an <span class=code><span class=keyword>int</span></span> requires rounding off.  C++ doesn't perform this operation automatically, in order to make sure that you, as the programmer, are aware of the loss of the fractional part of the number.</p>

<p>The simplest way to convert a floating-point value to an integer is to use a <b>typecast</b>.  Typecasting is so called because it allows you to take a value that belongs to one type and "cast" it into another type (in the sense of molding or reforming, not throwing).</p>

<p>The syntax for typecasting is like the syntax for a function call.  For example:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>double</span> pi = 3.14159;
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> x = <span class=keyword>int</span> (pi);
<br></span><p>The <span class=code><span class=keyword>int</span></span> function returns an integer, so <span class=code>x</span> gets the value 3.  Converting to an integer always rounds down, even if the fraction part is 0.99999999.</p>

<p>For every type in C++, there is a corresponding function that typecasts its argument to the appropriate type.</p>

<a name=3></a><br>
<h3>3.3 Math functions</h3>

<p>In mathematics, you have probably seen functions like <tt>sin</tt> and <tt>log</tt>, and you have learned to evaluate expressions like <tt>sin(pi/2)</tt> and <tt>log(1/x)</tt>.  First, you evaluate the expression in parentheses, which is called the <b>argument</b> of the function.  For example, <tt>pi/2</tt> is approximately 1.571, and <tt>1/x</tt> is 0.1 (if <tt>x</tt> happens to be 10).</p>

<p>Then you can evaluate the function itself, either by looking it up in a table or by performing various computations.  The <tt>sin</tt> of 1.571 is 1, and the <tt>log</tt> of 0.1 is -1 (assuming that <tt>log</tt> indicates the logarithm base 10).</p>

<p>This process can be applied repeatedly to evaluate more complicated expressions like <tt>log(1/sin(pi/2))</tt>.  First we evaluate the argument of the innermost function, then evaluate the function, and so on.</p>

<p>C++ provides a set of built-in functions that includes most of the mathematical operations you can think of. The math functions are invoked using a syntax that is similar to mathematical notation:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=keyword>double</span> log = log (17.0);
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=keyword>double</span> angle = 1.5;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=keyword>double</span> height = sin (angle);
<br></span><p>The first example sets <span class=code>log</span> to the logarithm of 17, base <tt>e</tt>.  There is also a function called <span class=code>log10</span> that takes logarithms base 10.</p>

<p>The second example finds the sine of the value of the variable <span class=code>angle</span>.  C++ assumes that the values you use with <span class=code>sin</span> and the other trigonometric functions (<span class=code>cos</span>, <span class=code>tan</span>) are in <i>radians</i>.  To convert from degrees to radians, you can divide by 360 and multiply by <tt>2 pi</tt>.</p>

<p>If you don't happen to know <tt>pi</tt> to 15 digits, you can calculate it using the <span class=code>acos</span> function.  The arccosine (or inverse cosine) of -1 is <tt>pi</tt>, because the cosine of <tt>pi</tt> is -1.</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>double</span> pi = acos(-1.0);
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>double</span> degrees = 90;
<br>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>double</span> angle = degrees * 2 * pi / 360.0;
<br></span><p>Before you can use any of the math functions, you have to include the math <b>header file</b>.  Header files contain information the compiler needs about functions that are defined outside your program.  For example, in the "Hello, world!" program we included a header file named <span class=code>iostream.h</span> using an <b>include</b> statement:</p>


<span class=code>#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
<br></span><p><span class=code>iostream.h</span> contains information about input and output (I/O) streams, including the object named <span class=code>cout</span>.</p>



<p>Similarly, the math header file contains information about the math functions.  You can include it at the beginning of your program along with <span class=code>iostream.h</span>:</p>


<span class=code>#include &lt;math.h&gt;
<br></span><a name=4></a><br>
<h3>3.4 Composition</h3>

<p>Just as with mathematical functions, C++ functions can be <b>composed</b>, meaning that you use one expression as part of another. For example, you can use any expression as an argument to a function:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>double</span> x = cos (angle + pi/2);
<br></span><p>This statement takes the value of <span class=code>pi</span>, divides it by two and adds the result to the value of <span class=code>angle</span>.  The sum is then passed as an argument to the <span class=code>cos</span> function.</p>

<p>You can also take the result of one function and pass it as an argument to another:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>double</span> x = exp (log (10.0));
<br></span><p>This statement finds the log base <tt>e</tt> of 10 and then raises <tt>e</tt> to that power.  The result gets assigned to <span class=code>x</span>; I hope you know what it is.</p>

<a name=5></a><br>
<h3>3.5 Adding new functions</h3>

<p>So far we have only been using the functions that are built into C++, but it is also possible to add new functions.  Actually, we have already seen one function definition: <span class=code>main</span>.  The function named <span class=code>main</span> is special because it indicates where the execution of the program begins, but the syntax for <span class=code>main</span> is the same as for any other function definition:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>void</span> NAME ( LIST OF PARAMETERS ) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; STATEMENTS
<br>&nbsp; }
<br></span><p>You can make up any name you want for your function, except that you can't call it <span class=code>main</span> or any other C++ keyword.  The list of parameters specifies what information, if any, you have to provide in order to use (or <b>call</b>) the new function.</p>

<p><span class=code>main</span> doesn't take any parameters, as indicated by the empty parentheses <span class=code>()</span> in it's definition.  The first couple of functions we are going to write also have no parameters, so the syntax looks like this:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>void</span> newLine () {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; endl;
<br>&nbsp; }
<br></span><p>This function is named <span class=code>newLine</span>; it contains only a single statement, which outputs a newline character, represented by the special value <span class=code>endl</span>.</p>

<p>In <span class=code>main</span> we can call this new function using syntax that is similar to the way we call the built-in C++ commands:</p>


<span class=code><span class=keyword>void</span> main ()
<br>{
<br>&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>"First Line."</span> &lt;&lt; endl;
<br>&nbsp; newLine ();
<br>&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>"Second Line."</span> &lt;&lt; endl;
<br>}
<br></span><p>The output of this program is</p>


<span class=code>First line.
<br>
<br>Second line.
<br></span><p>Notice the extra space between the two lines.  What if we wanted more space between the lines?  We could call the same function repeatedly:</p>


<span class=code><span class=keyword>void</span> main ()
<br>{
<br>&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>"First Line."</span> &lt;&lt; endl;
<br>&nbsp; newLine ();
<br>&nbsp; newLine ();
<br>&nbsp; newLine ();
<br>&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>"Second Line."</span> &lt;&lt; endl;
<br>}
<br></span><p>Or we could write a new function, named <span class=code>threeLine</span>, that prints three new lines:</p>


<span class=code><span class=keyword>void</span> threeLine ()
<br>{
<br>&nbsp; newLine ();&nbsp; newLine ();&nbsp; newLine ();
<br>}
<br>
<br><span class=keyword>void</span> main ()
<br>{
<br>&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>"First Line."</span> &lt;&lt; endl;
<br>&nbsp; threeLine ();
<br>&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>"Second Line."</span> &lt;&lt; endl;
<br>}
<br></span><p>You should notice a few things about this program:</p>

<ul>

<li>You can call the same procedure repeatedly.  In fact, it is quite common and useful to do so.</li>

<li>You can have one function call another function.  In this case, <span class=code>main</span> calls <span class=code>threeLine</span> and <span class=code>threeLine</span> calls <span class=code>newLine</span>.  Again, this is common and useful.</li>

<li>In <span class=code>threeLine</span> I wrote three statements all on the same line, which is syntactically legal (remember that spaces and new lines usually don't change the meaning of a program). On the other hand, it is usually a better idea to put each statement on a line by itself, to make your program easy to read.  I sometimes break that rule in this book to save space.</li>

</ul>

<p>So far, it may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to create all these new functions.  Actually, there are a lot of reasons, but this example only demonstrates two:</p>

<ol>

<li>Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to give a name to a group of statements.  Functions can simplify a program by hiding a complex computation behind a single command, and by using English words in place of arcane code.  Which is clearer, <span class=code>newLine</span> or <span class=code>cout &lt;&lt; endl</span>?</li>

<li>Creating a new function can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code.  For example, a short way to print nine consecutive new lines is to call <span class=code>threeLine</span> three times.  How would you print 27 new lines?</li>

</ol>

<a name=6></a><br>
<h3>3.6 Definitions and uses</h3>

<p>Pulling together all the code fragments from the previous section, the whole program looks like this:</p>


<span class=code>#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
<br>
<br><span class=keyword>void</span> newLine ()
<br>{
<br>&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; endl;
<br>}
<br>
<br><span class=keyword>void</span> threeLine ()
<br>{
<br>&nbsp; newLine ();&nbsp; newLine ();&nbsp; newLine ();
<br>}
<br>
<br><span class=keyword>void</span> main ()
<br>{
<br>&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>"First Line."</span> &lt;&lt; endl;
<br>&nbsp; threeLine ();
<br>&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>"Second Line."</span> &lt;&lt; endl;
<br>}
<br></span><p>This program contains three function definitions: <span class=code>newLine</span>, <span class=code>threeLine</span>, and <span class=code>main</span>.</p>

<p>Inside the definition of <span class=code>main</span>, there is a statement that uses or calls <span class=code>threeLine</span>.  Similarly, <span class=code>threeLine</span> calls <span class=code>newLine</span> three times.  Notice that the definition of each function appears above the place where it is used.</p>

<p>This is necessary in C++; the definition of a function must appear before (above) the first use of the function.  You should try compiling this program with the functions in a different order and see what error messages you get.</p>

<a name=7></a><br>
<h3>3.7 Programs with multiple functions</h3>

<p>When you look at a class definition that contains several functions, it is tempting to read it from top to bottom, but that is likely to be confusing, because that is not the <b>order of execution</b> of the program.</p>

<p>Execution always begins at the first statement of <span class=code>main</span>, regardless of where it is in the program (often it is at the bottom). Statements are executed one at a time, in order, until you reach a function call.  Function calls are like a detour in the flow of execution.  Instead of going to the next statement, you go to the first line of the called function, execute all the statements there, and then come back and pick up again where you left off.</p>

<p>That sounds simple enough, except that you have to remember that one function can call another.  Thus, while we are in the middle of <span class=code>main</span>, we might have to go off and execute the statements in <span class=code>threeLine</span>.  But while we are executing <span class=code>threeLine</span>, we get interrupted three times to go off and execute <span class=code>newLine</span>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, C++ is adept at keeping track of where it is, so each time <span class=code>newLine</span> completes, the program picks up where it left off in <span class=code>threeLine</span>, and eventually gets back to <span class=code>main</span> so the program can terminate.</p>

<p>What's the moral of this sordid tale?  When you read a program, don't read from top to bottom.  Instead, follow the flow of execution.</p>

<a name=8></a><br>
<h3>3.8 Parameters and arguments</h3>

<p>Some of the built-in functions we have used have <b>parameters</b>, which are values that you provide to let the function do its job.  For example, if you want to find the sine of a number, you have to indicate what the number is.  Thus, <span class=code>sin</span> takes a <span class=code><span class=keyword>double</span></span> value as a parameter.</p>

<p>Some functions take more than one parameter, like <span class=code>pow</span>, which takes two <span class=code>doubles</span>, the base and the exponent.</p>

<p>Notice that in each of these cases we have to specify not only how many parameters there are, but also what type they are.  So it shouldn't surprise you that when you write a class definition, the parameter list indicates the type of each parameter.  For example:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>void</span> printTwice (<span class=keyword>char</span> phil) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; phil &lt;&lt; phil &lt;&lt; endl;
<br>&nbsp; }
<br></span><p>This function takes a single parameter, named <span class=code>phil</span>, that has type <span class=code><span class=keyword>char</span></span>.  Whatever that parameter is (and at this point we have no idea what it is), it gets printed twice, followed by a newline. I chose the name <span class=code>phil</span> to suggest that the name you give a parameter is up to you, but in general you want to choose something more illustrative than <span class=code>phil</span>.</p>

<p>In order to call this function, we have to provide a <span class=code><span class=keyword>char</span></span>. For example, we might have a <span class=code>main</span> function like this:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>void</span> main () {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; printTwice (<span class=quote>'a'</span>);
<br>&nbsp; }
<br></span><p>The <span class=code><span class=keyword>char</span></span> value you provide is called an <b>argument</b>, and we say that the argument is <b>passed</b> to the function.  In this case the value <span class=code><span class=quote>'a'</span></span> is passed as an argument to <span class=code>printTwice</span> where it will get printed twice.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if we had a <span class=code><span class=keyword>char</span></span> variable, we could use it as an argument instead:</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>void</span> main () {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>char</span> argument = <span class=quote>'b'</span>;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; printTwice (argument);
<br>&nbsp; }
<br></span><p>Notice something very important here: the name of the variable we pass as an argument (<span class=code>argument</span>) has nothing to do with the name of the parameter (<span class=code>phil</span>).  Let me say that again:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px;">

<p><b>The name of the variable we pass as an argument has nothing to do with the name of the parameter.</b></p>

</p>

<p>They can be the same or they can be different, but it is important to realize that they are not the same thing, except that they happen to have the same value (in this case the character <span class=code><span class=quote>'b'</span></span>).</p>

<p>The value you provide as an argument must have the same type as the parameter of the function you call.  This rule is important, but it is sometimes confusing because C++ sometimes converts arguments from one type to another automatically.  For now you should learn the general rule, and we will deal with exceptions later.</p>

<a name=9></a><br>
<h3>3.9 Parameters and variables are local</h3>

<p>Parameters and variables only exist inside their own functions.  Within the confines of <span class=code>main</span>, there is no such thing as <span class=code>phil</span>. If you try to use it, the compiler will complain.  Similarly, inside <span class=code>printTwice</span> there is no such thing as <span class=code>argument</span>.</p>

<p>Variables like this are said to be <b>local</b>.  In order to keep track of parameters and local variables, it is useful to draw a <b>stack diagram</b>.  Like state diagrams, stack diagrams show the value of each variable, but the variables are contained in larger boxes that indicate which function they belong to.</p>

<p>For example, the state diagram for <span class=code>printTwice</span> looks like this:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/stack.png"></p>

<p>Whenever a function is called, it creates a new <b>instance</b> of that function.  Each instance of a function contains the parameters and local variables for that function.  In the diagram an instance of a function is represented by a box with the name of the function on the outside and the variables and parameters inside.</p>

<p>In the example, <span class=code>main</span> has one local variable, <span class=code>argument</span>, and no parameters.  <span class=code>printTwice</span> has no local variables and one parameter, named <span class=code>phil</span>.</p>

<a name=10></a><br>
<h3>3.10 Functions with multiple parameters</h3>

<p>The syntax for declaring and invoking functions with multiple parameters is a common source of errors.  First, remember that you have to declare the type of every parameter.  For example</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; <span class=keyword>void</span> printTime (<span class=keyword>int</span> hour, <span class=keyword>int</span> minute) {
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; hour;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; <span class=quote>":"</span>;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; minute;
<br>&nbsp; }
<br></span><p>It might be tempting to write <span class=code>(<span class=keyword>int</span> hour, minute)</span>, but that format is only legal for variable declarations, not for parameters.</p>

<p>Another common source of confusion is that you do not have to declare the types of arguments.  The following is wrong!</p>


<span class=code>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> hour = 11;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=keyword>int</span> minute = 59;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; printTime (<span class=keyword>int</span> hour, <span class=keyword>int</span> minute);&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=comment>// WRONG!
</span><br></span><p>In this case, the compiler can tell the type of <span class=code>hour</span> and <span class=code>minute</span> by looking at their declarations.  It is unnecessary and illegal to include the type when you pass them as arguments.  The correct syntax is <span class=code>printTime (hour, minute)</span>.</p>

<a name=11></a><br>
<h3>3.11 Functions with results</h3>

<p>You might have noticed by now that some of the functions we are using, like the math functions, yield results.  Other functions, like <span class=code>newLine</span>, perform an action but don't return a value.  That raises some questions:</p>

<ul>

<li>What happens if you call a function and you don't do anything with the result (i.e. you don't assign it to a variable or use it as part of a larger expression)?</li>

<li>What happens if you use a function without a result as part of an expression, like <span class=code>newLine() + 7</span>?</li>

<li>Can we write functions that yield results, or are we stuck with things like <span class=code>newLine</span> and <span class=code>printTwice</span>?</li>

</ul>

<p>The answer to the third question is "yes, you can write functions that return values," and we'll do it in a couple of chapters.  I will leave it up to you to answer the other two questions by trying them out.  Any time you have a question about what is legal or illegal in C++, a good way to find out is to ask the compiler.</p>
